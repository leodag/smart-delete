# smart-delete

Handle backspace/delete like IntelliJ IDEs.

When `smart-delete-mode` is enabled, do a smart delete, unless:
* Called with an argument
* Inside a string literal
* Have non-spacing characters before/after point (for backward/forward deletes, respectively)

Deletes region when region is active and delete-active-region is non-nil.

A smart delete consists of:

When smart deleting backward:
- If after indentation level, go back to indentation
- If at or before indentation level, delete to end of previous line

When smart deleting forward:
- Delete spaces after point
- Smart delete backward at next line

## Usage:

```
(smart-delete-mode 1)
```
